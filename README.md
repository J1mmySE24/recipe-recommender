## New Features

Filter Recipes by Preparation Time:
With busy schedules in mind, we‚Äôve introduced a filter that allows users to search for recipes based on preparation time. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a quick 15-minute meal or are ready to try a more elaborate recipe, you can now filter recipes to match your available cooking time. This feature is perfect for users who want efficient meal planning and time management in the kitchen. <br>

Dark Mode Theme Switch:
The app now includes a dark mode theme to enhance user comfort and accessibility. With a single toggle, users can switch between light and dark themes, choosing the one that suits their preference or ambient lighting conditions. Dark mode reduces eye strain in low-light settings, providing a user-friendly and modern interface experience. <br>

Recipe Reviews and Ratings:
We‚Äôve added a reviews and ratings feature to allow users to share their feedback on recipes they‚Äôve tried. This feature not only helps other users make informed choices but also encourages community engagement. Users can read reviews, see average ratings, and contribute their own reviews, creating a collaborative environment for food lovers. <br>

These new features collectively make Saveurs S√©lection a more comprehensive, user-centric, and interactive app, transforming it into a community-driven platform where users can discover, share, and personalize their cooking experiences. Whether you‚Äôre cooking on a time limit, exploring a new cuisine, or looking for innovative recipes, Saveurs S√©lection is designed to make every meal a delightful adventure. <br>
